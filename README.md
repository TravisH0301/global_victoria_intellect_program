# The Global Victoria Intellect Program
As part of the global victoria intellect program 2020, conducting an international market research analysis, data processing and data visualisation were done using Python to identify the top 5 emerging beauty brands in the Chinese market. <Br>
The data was obtained from Passport, a market intelligence software.

## Top 5 emerging brands
From 3 different categories of 'beauty and personal care', 'Premium beauty and personal care' and 'Mass beauty and personal care', the following brands were selected as emerging brands based on how recently they were launched in China and how robust their growths were.
- AHC (Unilever Group)
-	Aveeno (Johnson & Johnson Inc)
-	IOPE (AmorePacific Corp)
-	Nars (Shiseido Co Ltd)	
-	SU:M37 (LG Household & Health Care Ltd)

## Limitations
### Limited market data
Due to limited Chinese market data, the brands that launched after 2018 could not be considered and the emerging brands were selected based on their performance upto 2018.
### Difference in Retail Value RSP between premium and non-premium brands
Premium brands are advantaged against non-premium brands in terms of the retail value growth due to their nature of higher selling prices.
This difference was not compromised in selecting emerging brands based on growth in the retail value.
